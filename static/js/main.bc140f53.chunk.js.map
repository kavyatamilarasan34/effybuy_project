One RFQ\r\n                    takes 2 days to share it to the vendors. With Effybuy, We\r\n                    share RFQ’s in minutes eliminating time in comparing the\r\n                    quotations manually. The Negotiations consume more than a\r\n                    week to select a particular vendor but now, With Reverse\r\n                    Auctions, We complete our Negotiations within an hour and\r\n                    get complete comparison Analytics without any human\r\n                    intervention.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <h6 className=\"name\">GO AIR</h6>\r\n                  <span className=\"font-rubik disg-info\">Manager</span>\r\n                </div>{\" \"}\r\n                {/* /.feedback-wrapper */}\r\n                <div\r\n                  className=\"feedback-wrapper\"\r\n                  data-aos=\"fade-up\"\r\n                  data-aos-duration=\"1200\"\r\n                >\r\n                  <img src={MClogo} alt=\"\" className=\"media-meta\" />\r\n                  <p>\r\n                    The RFQ process , when generated manually, created a lot of\r\n                    confusion with our Emails all over the inbox.
